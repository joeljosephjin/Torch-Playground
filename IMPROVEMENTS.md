- ✅ Multiple CNN architectures implemented (DenseNet, ResNet, custom models)
- ✅ WandB integration for experiment tracking
- ✅ Model checkpointing and resume functionality
- ✅ Reproducible experiments with seed setting
- ✅ Support for CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets

### Areas for Improvement

## 🚀 High Priority Improvements (Quick Wins)

### 1. Development Tools & Automation
**Impact: High | Effort: Low**

Add essential development tools to improve code quality and consistency:

```bash
# Development dependencies to add
pip install black isort flake8 mypy pytest pytest-cov
```

**Files to create:**
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Automated code formatting
- `pyproject.toml` - Modern Python project configuration
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Continuous integration
- `Makefile` - Common development tasks

### 2. Code Structure Refactoring
**Impact: High | Effort: Medium**

Break down the monolithic `main.py` into focused modules:

```
src/
├── torch_playground/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── config.py          # Configuration management
│   ├── trainer.py         # Training logic
│   ├── evaluator.py       # Evaluation logic
│   ├── models/            # Model definitions
│   ├── data/              # Data loading utilities
│   └── utils/             # Utility functions
├── scripts/
│   ├── train.py           # Training script
│   └── evaluate.py        # Evaluation script
└── tests/                 # Test suite
```

### 3. Configuration Management
**Impact: Medium | Effort: Low**

Replace command-line arguments with structured configuration:

```yaml
# configs/base.yaml
model:
  name: "DenseNet3"
  params:
    growth_rate: 12
    depth: 40

training:
  epochs: 300
  batch_size: 64
  learning_rate: 0.1
  optimizer: "SGD"
  
data:
  dataset: "cifar_10"
  augmentation: true
  
experiment:
  use_wandb: true
  project: "torch-cnn"
```

## 🔧 Medium Priority Improvements

### 4. Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
**Impact: Medium | Effort: Medium**

```python
# tests/test_models.py
def test_densenet_forward_pass():
    model = DenseNet3(depth=40, num_classes=10, growth_rate=12)
    x = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)
    output = model(x)
    assert output.shape == (1, 10)

# tests/test_data.py
def test_cifar10_dataloader():
    train_loader, test_loader = load_cifar_10(batch_size=4)
    batch = next(iter(train_loader))
    assert len(batch) == 2  # images, labels
    assert batch[0].shape[0] == 4  # batch size
```
